# Newspaper Analytics: Web App

In this repo, I will save the web app in where I show the data recolected and analized by the scraper and NLP model.

## Technical Details

The technologies used to build the project are:

- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Nginx
- Gunicorn
- AWS RDS -> MySQL
- EC2 -> Web Hosting


## Design
In my opinion, newspapers should represent sincerity and transparency, for that reason I chose a **glassed style** and colors that represent those emotions. <br>
I used css to styling the web. <br>
When I chose the fonts, I quickly leaned towards Serif fonts, but they didn't meet my expectations. That's why I chose a Sans Serif font that fits with the web style.
  
## For the Future
I want to:
- Improve the loading times. In the future I will try to implement Polars, a library write in Rust, that allows data process faster.
- Improve the design.
- Add graphs like Scatter Plot, to show how the positivity varies over time.
- Use a better NLP model to get more accurated predictions.
